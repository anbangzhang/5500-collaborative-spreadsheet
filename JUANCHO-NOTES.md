## Notes on the project
Overall you delivered on the project brief.  I can see how the three of you worked together to deliver on this project.

My overall assessment of the project is that this project deserves an A.  I am awarding 25 points for the executable.  The documentation does also cover the brief of the project.  I am awarding 5 points for the documentation.

It is a demo that was put together while you were learning to work as a team and thus I did not expect the project to be perfect.  The notes here are for you to consider as takeaways from a customer experience of using your product.

1. On the main page, 
    * Why do i have to click to see the listing of all the sheets?

    * If i have not clicked the list sheets when i start then When I create a sheet i get no response as to whether or not the sheet was successfully created.
1. On the spreadsheet page
    * The look of the edit sheet is great.  I like the layout and the clean look
    * There is no way to go back to the main sheet?  I had to edit the URL to get to the main sheet.
    * It appears as though you are storing a single user for a browser.  (I cannot have two tabs with different users)
    * I like that cells being edited are highlit with the name of the user.
    * The functions do not work like they do in a calculator.  On a calculator the functions like x_square work on the previous value.  so for example 4 x_square would result in 16.  you are requiring the user to use the functions like programming functions.   I am curious as to why you chose to implement this way.  ()
